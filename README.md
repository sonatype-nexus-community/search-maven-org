## Prerequisites

You will need node setup, preferably something fresh. At least one of us uses `nvm` to manage node, for SASS you'll want a version newer than 6.0.0 I believe.

It's important to note, as part of understanding this project, how and why it was intially setup.

* Technology choices
  * Angular 6 - Really low start up cost to learn and to implement
  * Angular CLI - Command Line tool for super easy creation of Angular components
  * Typescript - Easy language for most of our developers to jump on
  * NPM - package manager that is supported by Nexus Repository
    * You can use Yarn if you'd like
  * SASS - currently one of the best CSS precompilers
  * Angular Material 6 - Easy setup of a simple UI look and feel
    * We followed the [Quick start guide from Angular](https://angular.io/guide/quickstart)

## Installation
* NPM
  * install npm from https://nodejs.org/en/
  * install the latest angular cli with `npm install -g @angular/cli@latest`
  * install all other dependencies with `npm install` from project root

* Yarn
  * install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
  * install angular cli with `yarn global add @angular/cli@latest`
  * install all other dependencies with `yarn` from project root

### Development

#### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

#### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

#### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

#### Running unit tests

Currently not running, help us out and get them running!

#### Running end-to-end tests

Currently not running, help us out and get them running!

#### Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

#### Style Guide

We currently follow the [Angular.io style guide](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide).

#### IntelliJ Settings

* Preferences > Editor > Code Style > TypeScript > Spaces > Within : Enable "ES6 import/export" braces

#### Data

Using this externally, you'll need to wire up to `http://search.maven.org/solrsearch/select` similar to how we do in Production. You can see these settings in `environment.prod.ts`. 

You'll likely need to use a plugin to modify CORS headers as this will produce a cross domain request, there are quite a few plugins out there. For Chrome you can use [this one](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi).
